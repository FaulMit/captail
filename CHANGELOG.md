# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Saving a replay now shows a "Saving replay…" notification immediately; the "Replay saved" confirmation replaces it once the file is on disk, instead of appearing only after the write finished.
- Overlay notifications no longer let a previous notification's fade-out dismiss a newer notification that appeared during it.

### Changed

- Renamed remaining solution, project, namespace, icon, and native bridge identifiers to Captail.
- Added a real interface screenshot and an OBS Replay Buffer comparison to the README.
- Standardized repository comments and diagnostic messages in English.
